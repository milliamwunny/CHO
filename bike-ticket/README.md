# 🚗💩 Fake Parking Violation Prank

A guerrilla comedy project designed to scare, confuse, and roast random drivers.

## ⚠️ THE SETUP

**Step 1: Print fake parking tickets**  
QR codes lead to a website that starts with a horrifying image loop of a gaped butthole and diarrhea fountain, overlaid with fart noises and Vietnamese insults.

**Step 2: Appeal link → More Insults**  
If they click “appeal”, they're greeted by a GIF of a Vietnamese man having a meltdown, paired with angry audio and flashing text like “XE MÀY NHƯ CẶC!” and “BỐ MÀY ĐÂY!”
